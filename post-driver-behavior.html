      <h2>Driver Behavior Analysis — Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
      <p class="date">February 2026</p>

      <p>
        I chose this topic partly because of my interest in automotive subjects. I am currently
        working on another project focused on vehicle information from car sales websites, so a
        driver-focused analysis felt like a natural complement — shifting attention from the car
        itself to the person behind the wheel.
      </p>

      <h3>The Research Question</h3>
      <p>
        The central question driving this analysis was: <em>what sensor signals most clearly
        distinguish aggressive, distracted, and normal driving behavior?</em> More specifically —
        do aggressive drivers consistently show higher speed and harder braking? Is phone usage a
        reliable indicator of distraction, or do signals like lane deviation and reaction time tell
        a richer story? And which features best separate the three behavior categories?
      </p>

      <h3>The Dataset</h3>
      <p>
        The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and simulates onboard diagnostic (OBD) and
        accelerometer readings captured during individual driving events. Each of the 30,000 rows
        represents a single moment in time, described by 11 sensor-based features: speed, forward
        and lateral acceleration, brake pressure, steering angle, throttle position, lane
        deviation, phone usage, headway distance (gap to the car ahead), reaction time, and a
        behavior label — either <em>Aggressive</em>, <em>Distracted</em>, or <em>Normal</em>.
        There were no missing values, and all three classes were exactly balanced at 10,000
        observations each — a clear sign of synthetic generation, but also a convenient property
        for fair group comparisons.
      </p>

      <h3>What the Data Showed</h3>
      <p>
        The box plots were the most revealing part of the analysis. Brake pressure turned out to
        be the single strongest separator between groups: aggressive drivers apply dramatically
        harder braking, while normal drivers brake most gently. Speed followed a similar pattern —
        aggressive drivers run faster, though distracted and normal drivers are much closer to
        each other, meaning speed alone cannot tell those two groups apart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lane deviation was the defining signature of distracted driving. Distracted drivers drifted
        the most from lane center, consistent with divided attention. Aggressive drivers also
        showed above-normal deviation, but for a different reason — likely high-speed maneuvering
        rather than inattention. Headway distance told a complementary story: aggressive drivers
        maintained the shortest following gap (tailgating), while normal drivers kept the largest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Phone usage was almost entirely concentrated in the distracted group, with near-zero rates
        in the other two. But it is not sufficient on its own — the scatter plots and box plots
        showed meaningful variation in lane deviation and reaction time within the distracted group
        regardless of phone use. The core signature of distracted driving in this dataset is really
        a combination of phone usage, elevated lane deviation, and a wider, more erratic reaction
        time distribution.
      </p>

      <p>
        One finding that stood out: aggressive drivers had <em>fast</em> reaction times — not slow
        ones. This might seem counterintuitive, but it reflects the nature of high-risk driving.
        These drivers are constantly reacting to the high-intensity situations they create, not
        being cautious. Distracted drivers, by contrast, scattered across a wide reaction time
        range, consistent with inconsistent attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        The correlation matrix confirmed that most features are weakly correlated with each other,
        meaning each visualization contributed independent information. The one exception was a
        moderate positive correlation between speed and throttle — expected, since going faster
        requires more throttle. Everything else was largely independent.
      </p>

      <h3>Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        The main caveat here is that the data is synthetic. Real telematics data would include road
        type, speed limits, weather, and time of day — context that fundamentally changes the
        meaning of a reading. 100 km/h on a highway is normal; the same speed on a residential
        street is dangerous. Without that context, patterns in this dataset partly reflect the
        assumptions built into how the data was generated rather than actual human behavior.
        Additionally, observations are treated as independent, when in reality readings from a
        single driver form a correlated time series.
      </p>

      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>
        No single sensor reading reliably identifies a driver's behavior — group overlap in the
        scatter plots makes that clear. But the combination of speed, brake pressure, lane
        deviation, and reaction time produces coherent and distinct profiles for each group. The
        analysis confirmed that distraction and aggression are behaviorally distinct: aggression
        is characterized by intensity and speed, while distraction shows up as inattention and
        drift — two fundamentally different failure modes that would require different detection
        strategies in a real safety system.
