      <h2>Ethically Ambiguous Data Modeling</h2>
      <p class="date">January 2026</p>

      <p>
        Data modeling can be defined as a technical activity where data is collected
        and the best model to use for the data is selected and tested for performance.
        However, it should be noted that most data models operate in ethically ambiguous
        spaces. Ethically ambiguous data modeling can be defined as the creation and use
        of models whose social impacts are uncertain, unevenly distributed, or misaligned
        with the intent suggested by the models' technical success.
      </p>

      <p>
        The question of what makes a data modeling practice ethically ambiguous is complex.
        It does not necessarily imply wrongdoing or the failure to adhere to best practices.
        Data models often make use of incomplete and biased data sets that are representative
        of past inequalities rather than the truth. Other data models may be based on proxy
        variables that indirectly discriminate against certain groups of people. Data models
        may also be technically successful but fail to address the social inequalities that
        exist among the people.
      </p>

      <p>
        To responsibly operate in these gray areas, several foundational practices are
        necessary. First, data auditing is critical in recognizing where there is a lack
        of data, biased representations, or poor proxies. This allows the modeler to make
        better decisions rather than assuming the data is neutral. Second, stakeholder
        engagement is critical in grounding the model in the lived experience. Interacting
        with the communities or stakeholders that the model will impact can provide
        additional context to the modeler on the risks that the model is taking on, as well
        as whether the model’s purpose is actually in alignment with the values of the
        community.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, in the creation of a hiring screening model that accurately predicts
        employee performance, the model is technically successful. However, the model might
        actually perpetuate the same hiring biases that the data set was originally built
        on, inadvertently excluding qualified employees from underrepresented communities.
        The gray area here is not in the modeler’s intent, but in the model’s impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, the key to successful data modeling is less about finding the right
        answer and more about understanding the ambiguity in the process.
